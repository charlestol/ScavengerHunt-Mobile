/***  Adding user info to the database upon sign up ***/

db.collection("users").doc(user.email).set(
    (userType==='student') ? {
    firstName: firstName,
    lastName: lastName,
    email: email,
    studentID: studentID,
    uid: user.uid,
    userType: userType
    } : {
    firstName: firstName,
    lastName: lastName,
    email: email,
    uid: user.uid,
    userType: userType
    }
)

This code block accesses the user collection and creates a document named after the user's email (User email will serve as a unique user identifier). 
A ternary is used to handle the user type since student signup contains an additional piece of information.
The document is then populated with the user's inputted information.

db.collection("users").doc(user.email).get().then(function() { do something })

This line searches for an existing user in the database by looking up the email (email is used for a document's name)
